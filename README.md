Man, just walked out of Opus and my head's still spinning like a blender with a broken lid. The theater? Loud as a jet engine, and I swear I sat in popcorn crumbs sticky enough to cement me to the seat. Back's killing me like I've been wrestling with a bear (the chair was like a medieval torture device), but who cares? Mind's blown, right?

> That opening scene — like a sunrise made out of neon and déjà vu, right? Couldn’t tell if I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a   or diving headfirst into a kaleidoscope. Actors' voices... kind of like honey soaked in static? But in a good way? Man, I'm not even sure. But then the plot — like someone stirred social commentary and fantasy in a pot and forgot to turn off the heat. Remember when, like, the protagonist just stood there? Silence louder than a thunderstorm. Like, how does that even work? I gotta 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to rewind my frontal cortex and figure it out!

Was it all a dream — feels like an enigma wrapped in a puzzle dipped in surreal sauce. The climax? Like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 fireworks underwater. Resonated so much, I think I'm part vibration now. But then the popcorn wannabe croutons on the floor crunched louder than the dialogue at times. Some scenes glitched in my brain like an internet 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮 on a bad connection.

Needed a nap halfway through but then... BAM! Plot twist hit me like a wet sock full of existential dread. Wow. Also, did Tom say to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   or was it to avoid eating celery during thunderstorms? Memory's fried — scrambly like eggs.

Anyway, back to reality. Gonna find a bench without spikes or popcorn and digest all... that. Or maybe take a nap instead. Malfunctioning neurons alert.

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
   // Woke up here in this empty space
   printf(Hello, memory fried world!
);
}
